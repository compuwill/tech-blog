Once that is made, create the .env file with the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PW, and APP_SECRET. These are arbitrary depending on your system. Make sure you have MySQL installed. Next run npm install to install all necessary dependencies. After you've completed all of this, go ahead and run NPM start in bash.
